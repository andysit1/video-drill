Phase Two:
Represent scripts that will handle how we judge the clips ie how we select which clips are worthy in the video / the order.

Folder Use:
Mainly to hold scripts which I think I will use in the future and make them into methods.
Also, to plan out specific detection ideas which I think will be cool to see in my pipeline
